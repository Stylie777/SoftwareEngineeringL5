# Assignment

## Introduction 

This Django project contains a website for managing tickets in an IT company. The website is designed to be versatile to the users need's, where they have full control over the types of tickets that can be raised  Users can create their own types and statusts for the tickets, along with the tickets themselves.

## Accessing the webpage
The webpage is available online, for review, [here][online-webpage]. This can also be run locally by cloning this repository and running the Django server in your terminal.

### Running locally
1. Clone the git repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Stylie777/SoftwareEngineeringL5.git
```
1. Run the django server from the terminal. This should be done from the directory containing `manage.py`
```sh
python3 manage.py runserver
```

This will launch a local Django server where the website can be used. The database is also stored locally, so any changes made on the local copy will not be replicated on the hosted version.
